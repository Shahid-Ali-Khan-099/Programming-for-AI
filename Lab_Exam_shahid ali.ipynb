The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"Portable PlayStation ready to go\\n \\n Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.\\n \\n The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.\\n \\n Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.\\n \\n Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \\\"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\\\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.\\n \\n Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \\\"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\\\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \\\"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Tomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n \\n Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \\\"It's nothing serious,\\\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \\\"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\\\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. the other is china construction bank. both are expected to list abroad during .\\n \\n they shared a $bn state bailout in , to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n however, a report in the china-published economic observer said on monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in new york because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the enron scandal. bank of china is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while china construction bank is the largest deposit holder. china's banking sector is burdened with at least $bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. the most high-profile case involved the ex-president of bank of china, wang xuebing, jailed for  years in . although, he committed the offences whilst running bank of china in new york, mr wang was head of china construction bank when the scandal broke. earlier this month, a china construction bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n china's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. the introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. last year, china's premier, wen jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. china's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of china's economic boom. but two problems persist. first, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. another high profile financial firm, china life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the us securities and exchange commission following its  new york listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"fast moving phone viruses appear\\n \\n security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs.\\n \\n the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series  phone operating system. despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir.\\n \\n the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june  when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time.\\n \\n however, the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian's series  software is licenced by nokia, lg electronics, lenovo, panasonic, samsung, sendo and siemens.\\n\",\n          \"henson stakes early lions claim\\n \\n the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer.\\n \\n the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson. he's very confident. you just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance. he certainly showed some nice touches. he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. and that's without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. he needs to come up against brian o'driscoll or a big french midfield. wales fly-half stephen jones was another player who impressed me. he gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. he showed he can control a game. with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number  shirt could be up for grabs and jones, or maybe even henson, could make the lions team at fly-half.\\n \\n jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday's game. some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. however, i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame. some english players did their cause no harm. i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong. but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again. despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france.\\n \\n tom smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of chris cusiter, jason white and ally hogg all made their mark. hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward. the star of ireland's win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand. brian o'driscoll is a class act. he ran some good lines against italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. gordon d'arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson, d'arcy, o'driscoll combination in the lions midfield. paul o'connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm o'kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while shane byrne seems to be a lively character. but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday, although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be. one player who didn't impress me was wales scrum-half dwayne peel. he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing. they had good possession and he kicked the ball away - i wouldn't want him as my lions scrum-half after that.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent\\n \\n and that's when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use \\\"sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call\\\" he says\\n \\n \\\"in every rural community there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone or has a mobile phone and can receive messages\\\" half a world away in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago taran rampersad read morquendi's messages mr rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help mr rampersad said: \\\"imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets and had a central place to send a text message to that effect \\\"he can message the server so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field\\\" he added: \\\"or send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places\\\"\\n \\n mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september last week he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia\\n \\n in only  hours he found dan lane a text message guru living in britain the pair along with a group of dedicated techies are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help \\\"this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people\\\" says paul saffo a director at the california-based institute for the future \\\"you may be halfway around the world from someone but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away\\\" he said \\\"that's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy\\\" it is still very early days for the project though in an e-mail dan lane calls it \\\"an early proof of concept\\\" right now the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page or distribute it to an e-mail list in the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages but there's still another challenge you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use \\\"it's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that\\\" says mr rampersad \\\"so the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve - human communication\\\" he is optimistic however he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments too will sit up and take notice and he stands by his motto courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating\\n \\n clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh-boston
